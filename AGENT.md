The goal for this app is to help people to find locations to discard items that can't be thrown away in regular disposal, such as cooking oil, batteries, and car tires.

The location data is loaded from a csv named locais.csv in the res/raw directory.

The location data is loaded and managed in the data/DataSource.kt file.
